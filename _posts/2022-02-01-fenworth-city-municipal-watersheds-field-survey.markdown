    <i>On sunny days, when the warmth placates the wildlife downtown, I watch the egrets on Camera Six. They live in a marsh north of the metro area, where the Osborne River widens after snaking through the small city. I used to go there, away from the hustle and bustle, to do watercolor studies of the willows. Occasionally, a chipmunk or frog would inspect my travel easel, and Iâ€™d freeze my hand and hold my breath until they scampered away.</i></br></br>
